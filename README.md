# Hello Node!

This project includes a Node.js server script and a discord bot that connects to it. The discord bot tracks the scheduled games as well as standings and any live bruins game.

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/) is a popular runtime that lets you run server-side JavaScript.

## Prerequisites

You'll get best use out of this project if you're familiar with basic JavaScript. If you've written JavaScript for client-side web pages this is a little different because it uses server-side JS, but the syntax is the same!
